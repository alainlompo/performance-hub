<h2>Stress test your web application with Gatling</h2>

<p>Gatling's installation can be very simple: all that is needed is to unpack the bundle into a specific folder and to define a GATLING_HOME environement 
variable that points to it. You can find the bundle on <a href='http://gatling.io/#/'>Gatling's website</a>. Read the quickstart guide to get acquainted with the
basic features of Gatling and how to get it running quickly</p>

<h3>Generating a simulation scenario by using the recorder</h3>
Gatling uses scenarios written in <a href='http://www.scala-lang.org/'>Scala programming language</a> to run stress tests against web applications. Scala compiles into Java bytecode 
and runs on JVM. There is complete interoperability between Scala libraries and Java's (you can use one in the other and vice - versa). The simplest way to 
generate a basic simulation class is to use the recorder. Using the recorder, we browse the web application and we execute one or many use cases. then Gatling generates 
the simulation class that will be used next to play the stress tests. 

Again it is advisable to read the quickstart to get acquainted with these basic features. Once you have launched the recorder using the recorder script:

<ul>
	<li>$GATLING_HOME/bin/recorder.sh (on Unix like systems)</li>
	<li>%GATLING_HOME%\bin\recorder.bat (on Windows)</li>
</ul>,

you will have to specify a listening port for localhost HTTP/HTTPS and then configure the browser you will use to browse the tested web application. Manually configure a proxy that uses
the same listening port in a similar way as what is shown in the picture below (configuration for Mozilla firefox)<br/>

<br/>
You can of course use any available port instead of the one shown on the picture. Notice that depending on the customizations of your browser you may experience unpleasant
ssl handshake failures event after you have followed the quickstart exactly. In most cases, these errors will go away if you reset your browser's ssls and tls custom configurations.
In the case of Mozilla you can use the <b>about:config</b> page to do that.

<h3> The samples on this github's project</h3>

The first sample is made of the following files and folders that you find directly under the <b><gatling></b> folder:<br/>
<ul>
	<li>The <a href="https://github.com/alainlompo/performance-hub/blob/master/gatling/SimpleSimulation.scala">SimpleSimulation.scala</a> file that is generated by a recording session</li>
	<li>The <a href="https://github.com/alainlompo/performance-hub/blob/master/gatling/simplesimulation-1466129488803.zip">Zipped report</a> of a stress test session (download and unzip it on your local disk and browse the index.html to see Gatling in action)</li>
